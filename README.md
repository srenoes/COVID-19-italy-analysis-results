# COVID-19-italy-analysis-results
Data Analysis results based on Italian officials Corona province based data.

Mostly ODE based modelling and parameter fitting, but also other results

I'll share pictures and code and data

in the results directory are pictures I took as a snapshot from the analysis.

There is one big json file which includes the plot data
all the other sav files are generated by lmfit (https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/intro.html)
lmfit method was save_modelresult, fitresults can be loaded with load_modelresult
The json also contains the name of the saved .sav files

The code for the model function you see directly here.


Look at the wiki for more information about model and more

Example figure (succesfull fitting + extrapolation):
