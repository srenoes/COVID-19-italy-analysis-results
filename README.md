# COVID-19-italy-analysis-results
Data Analysis results based on Italian officials Corona province based data.

Mostly ODE based modelling and parameter fitting, but also other results

I'll share pictures and code and data

in the results directory are pictures I took as a snapshot from the analysis.

There is one big json file which includes the plot data.
All the other sav files are generated by lmfit (https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/intro.html).
lmfit method used to save the fitting results was save_modelresult, fitresults can be loaded with load_modelresult

The json also contains the name of the saved .sav files

The code for the model function you see directly above.


Look at the wiki for more information about model and more

Example figure (succesfull fitting + extrapolation):

And some figure I created with geopandas:

Plus some info on the fitted Basic reproduction number R0=beta/gamma (only succesfull fits):
